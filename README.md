# WaveTankPrinter

This "large format" 3D Printer is designed to be used for the production of fan blade molds and scaled boat models for testing in the Stellenbosch University Wave Tank
This project falls under the Final Year Project by Mr Matt Tate, supervised by Prof Chris Meyer. 

The printer is based on a flying gantry-style cartesian 3D Printer, with a total build volume of 1000x500x850mm. The Z motion is based on four independently-driven steppermotors, coupled to SF1204 ball screws and HGH15 Linear Rails. Y motion is based on two stepper motors driving 9mm belts on MGN12H rails. X motion is based on one stepper motor driving a single 6mm belt on a MGN12H rail

The frame is built on PG30-6060 and 3060 extrusions, while the XY is built on PG20-2020 and 4040 extrusions. 

Assembly uses inner corner and outer corner pre-cast brackets along with T nuts left,right and center.
